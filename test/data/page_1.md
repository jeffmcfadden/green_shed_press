Once upon a time, a bee named Burt had a bad case of arthritis. He couldn't fly, 
he couldn't buzz, he couldn't even make honey. But he could still write poetry. 
And so he did. He wrote a sonnet about his arthritis, and it was beautiful. 
It was so beautiful that all the other bees in the hive gathered around to hear it. 
They were moved to tears by Burt's words, and they vowed to take better care of 
him. And so they did. They brought him honey and pollen, and they sang to him every 
night. And Burt's arthritis got better. He was able to fly again, and buzz again, 
and make honey again. And he lived happily ever after. The end.

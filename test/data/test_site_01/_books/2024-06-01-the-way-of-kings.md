I saw this series recommended by someone I follow on Instagram, and I was
hooked from the beginning. I was new to Sanderson, and the world building
(which I love) really blew me away. This is a fantastic story set in an
incredible world, with deep, dynamic characters. I loved it and I'm looking
forward to the rest of the series.
